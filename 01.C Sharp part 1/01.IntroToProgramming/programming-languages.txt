Problem 11. Programming Languages

Perform a research (e.g. in Google or Wikipedia) and provide a short
list with information about the most popular programming languages.
How similar are they to C#? How do they differ from C#?
Write in a text file called “programming-languages.txt” at least five languages
along with 2-3 sentences about each of them. Use English.

Programming languages:
C
Java
JavaScript
Python
PHP

How similar are they to C#?
They are used very commonly by developers for creating applications.
Most of them are object-oriented.

How do they differ from C#?
C# is relevantly new programming language, which is easy to learn and very
powerfull.

C:
A lot of the new languages have borrowed directly or indirectly from C.
Some of C's characteristics include code portability and efficiency, ability to
access specific hardware addresses, low run-time demand on system resources.

Java:
Java is one of the most popular languages in use for client-server web applications.
One design goal of Java is portability, which means the programs written for the
Java platform must run similarly on any combination of hardware and operating
system with adequate runtime support.

JavaScript:
The most common use of JavaScript is to add client-side behavior to HTML pages.
It is also used in server-side network programming wih runtime environments such
as Node.js, game development and the creation of desktop and mobile applications.

Python:
Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented,
imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. It features dynamic
type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive
standard library.

PHP:
PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also
used as a generel-purpose programming language. PHP code can be simply mixed with
HTML code, or it can be used in combinations with various templating engines and
web frameworks.
